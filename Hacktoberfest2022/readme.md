# Hacktoberfest 2022 Umbraco package contributions

Packages are an essential part of the Umbraco ecosystem, thus package contributions are eligible for this year's Umbraco Hacktoberfest.

*All contributions must be on a package that supports (or adds support for) the current version of Umbraco, i.e. v10.*

## Contributors

If you are interested in contributing to an Umbraco package, check out the repos on the [Hacktoberfest package repo list](hacktoberfest-package-repos.md) - and make sure to read the contributing guidelines of the repo first.

It is always a good idea to comment on the issue you'd like to work on: to let the maintainer know that you are about to work on it and ask any questions you may have.

## Package creators

If you release a new open source Umbraco package this will count towards Umbraco's Hacktoberfest. Once you've published the package on the [Our website](https://our.umbraco.com), please follow the 'Package maintainers' instructions below and add the package to this year's list.

## Package maintainers

To get your repository ready for Hacktoberfest:

- Add the `hacktoberfest` topic to your repository to opt-in to the official Hacktoberfest. This also helps people know you're looking for contributions

- Identify the issues that have a well-defined scope and are self-contained, and then add labels to them such as 'Help wanted'

If you would like contributions to your package to count towards Umbraco's Hacktoberfest:

- Submit a pull request to the [Hacktoberfest 2022 package repo list](hacktoberfest-package-repos.md) that adds your package to the list (in alphabetical order). Ideally add it with a 'deep link' to those issues that you want help with

For issues to be considered valid they must be valuable contributions, which is up to the discretion of the package team and will be based on the [Hacktoberfest quality standards](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#spam), as well as relating to v10 of Umbraco.
