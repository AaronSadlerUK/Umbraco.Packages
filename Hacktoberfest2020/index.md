# Hacktoberfest 2020 package contributions

For the Umbraco Hacktoberfest celebration of 2020 we have decided to also count contributions to open source Umbraco packages.

## For package maintainers

If you maintain an open source package and have some issues you would like some help with, you can add your repo by submitting a pr to the [Hacktoberfest package repo list](hacktoberfest-package-repos.md) list. 

Please add it with a deep link to the correct filter of labels that are issues you'd like help with, so for example you can link to a filtered list of "help wanted" issues.

Example: [Articulate help wanted issues](https://github.com/Shazwazza/Articulate/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - https://github.com/Shazwazza/Articulate/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22

For the issue to be considered valid it must be a valuable contribution required, which is up to the discretion of the package team and will be based on the [Hacktoberfest quality standards](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details/#quality).

If you haven't heard already... the rules for the official Hacktoberfest were changed early in October in an attempt to stop maintainers being overwhelmed by spammers ðŸ˜¢. If you want people's contributions to your projects to be counted you need to:

- Classify your repositories with the `hacktoberfest` topic
- Apply `hacktoberfest-accepted` labels to pull requests that you accept

Check out the [Hacktoberfest update](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update) for further information and guidance on how to do this.


## For contributors

If you are interested in contributing to an Umbraco package, please check out the repos on the [Hacktoberfest package repo list](hacktoberfest-package-repos.md) list - and make sure to read the contributing guidelines of the repo first!

It is always a good idea to comment on the issue you'd like to work on, and let the maintainer know that you intend to work on it, also to ask any questions you may have!

### How do you know if it is a valid contribution?

First step is of course to ensure that your contribution is valuable. If you run through all the repos and add punctuation or fix typos in the comments it's not really valuable to the package. You should start by reading up on the [Hacktoberfest quality standards](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details/#quality), but if you are in doubt whether it counts for Umbraco, feel free to reach out to packages@umbraco.com!

During Hacktoberfest we will run through the repos and check for merged PR's and congratulate you on the PR and verify whether it counts for Umbraco Hacktoberfest! ðŸŽ‰
