# Hacktoberfest 2020 package contributions

For the Umbraco Hacktoberfest celebration of 2020 we have decided to also count contributions to open source Umbraco packages.

## For package maintainers

If you maintain an open source package and have some issues you would like some help with, you can get your issue(s) added by submitting a pr to the [Package issues](package-issues.md) list. 

For the issue to be considered valid it must be a valuable contribution required, which is up to the discretion of the package team and will be based on the [Hacktoberfest quality standards](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details/#quality).

## For contributors

If you are interested in contributing to an Umbraco package, please find and issue on [the list](package-issues.md) - and make sure to read the contributing guidelines of the repo first!

It is always a good idea to comment on the issue you'd like to work on, and let the maintainer know that you intend to work on it, also to ask any questions you may have!
