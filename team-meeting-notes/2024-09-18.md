## Community Teams visit

General consensus that it was a very useful and inspiring two days!
Perhaps could have had a bit more scheduled 'hacking' time, for our team at least.

## Working in Public

At the Teams visit we started a GitHub Project Board to help the team keep track of the Teams' ongoing progress. https://github.com/orgs/umbraco/projects/41

## Hacktoberfest

During the Teams visit the Packages repository was prepared for Umbraco's Hacktoberfest. As per recent years, contributing to Umbraco Packages and Projects are eligible for Umbraco's Hacktoberfest.

Need to encourage package developers to get their packages listed on the list of eligible packages / projects. Guidance for maintainers and contributors is here:

## v14 Progress

### UI Examples Project

Good progress was made on the [UI Examples project](https://github.com/umbraco/UI-Examples) during the Teams visit. Upgrading this project is a great learning opportunity on the v14+ backoffice.

### Templates for Creating Packages

Warren has taken on the task of getting the core package RCL template fit for purpose in v14
https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/pull/17108

We revisited the v14 extension bootstrapper demoed to us by Knowit

Discussed that Lotte's ["Opinionated Package Starter" Template](https://github.com/LottePitcher/opinionated-package-starter) is probably worth updating to v14 as it gives a good head start on the publishing to nuget, having a well maintained GitHub repository. It is more than just bootstrapping  extension-building code.

Also discussed whether 'Item' dotnet new templates could be made use of to help people make progress quicker. Needs investigation!

## Any other business
Next meeting is on 2nd October 2024.

## Tasks for next time
Ongoing tasks are being managed via the Package Team's [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/umbraco/projects/41)
