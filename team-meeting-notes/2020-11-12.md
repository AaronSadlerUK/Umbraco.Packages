# Package team meeting November 12th 2020

Attended by David, Jesper, Kevin, Lotte, Nik & Richard

## Umbpack status

Team members found out they don't have merge rights. Jesper will sort some access for them!
Umbpack is ready for a new release with 4 easy to merge prs, and we can then do a subsequent release with [Nathan's](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbPack/pull/46) and [Ronald's](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbPack/pull/52) prs, they need a bit of work and testing first though!

## Package templates status

The team has gone through the issues and PRs, and they're pretty much all handled now.
A good hack session for the community days next week could be to work on making the Umbraco version when installing a project template configurable. Several things need to be worked with - mainly packagd dependencies on the Umbraco package.

## Status on the Umbraco.Packages repo

All open issues on the Our repo that relate to packages are being moved over to here, so they can be managed by this team.

## Discussing community team days schedule

Had several ideas for hack topics for the community team days next week:

- Staring up Umbraco package awards - split from the regular Umbraco awards, solely focused on packages
- A way to include package documentation on Our through Our tooling / conventions
- Allow markdown for the package descriptions
- Allow multiple authors in packages
- Installing media through packages natively - like content
- Improving the discoverability of packages on Our
