# Package team meeting July 23rd 2020

Attended by Jesper, Kevin, Lotte & Nik

## New [Our dev db](https://github.com/umbraco/OurUmbraco#database-restore)

The Our dev db is out, means we can work on Our again ðŸŽ‰

## News surrounding the package format RFC: 

- NuGet in Netcore does not support static files, throws a big wrench in our plans
- Talked a lot about whether there are feasible alternatives, whether the zip format is good enough and how extra tooling can help bridge the gap, similar to what UmbPack has done for deploying packages
- Decided a good first step either way would be to unflatten the package structure to allow files to be in folders and to remove schema and content out of the package.xml file into seperate files per item. Gives better overview and brings it closer to NuGet if we are to make a switch in the future. Would need to be backwards compatible, an idea could be supporting both in the CMS, and let UmbPack convert between the 2
- As we don't really know what is possible any further actions will be pending the UniCore teams findings

## Package best practices

Talked about changes needed for packages to make them work on Linux, mainly ensuring paths, casing and newlines to work cross platform. Using methods like `Path.Combine` & `Environment.Newline`. Was decided we should create a "best practices" docs article for this and other things.

## Package templates project

Talked status on the [package templates project](https://github.com/umbraco/Package.Templates). Need to get it published to NuGet, need to get some docs both on how to use it and how to contribute to it, and need to spread awareness of it.

## Hacktoberfest

- One idea was to create a "Getting started with Packages" workshop, could be used for Packathons
- Reach out to package devs and ask them if they have any issues / ideas for improvements in their packages they'd like help with, curate a list on this repo of all the issues for Hacktoberfest to spread awareness
- Create good starter issues for our repos (UmbPack, Package templates & Our)

## Next project for the package team

Talked next steps & what to focus on - shared interest in improving Our now that we have the option again. More focus on improving old designs, making it easier to find packages & revamp some of the old systems (compatibility & likes).
