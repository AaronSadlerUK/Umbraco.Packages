# Package team meeting November 18th 2021
Attendees: Andy, Dave, David, Kevin, Lotte, Richard, Ronald

## Agenda
- Handover/introduction
- Discuss team goals
- Any other business
- Tasks for next time

## Handover/introduction
The team stewardship got 'officially' handed over from Andy to Ronald.

## Discuss team goals
We went over the existing tasks/goals and discussed what we want to focus on the short and long term.

Short term goals:
- Add build/deploy pipeline to UI Examples
  - Ronald already has time allocated for this in the current sprint
  - Lotte noted that we should add a note/link to the UI Library to avoid confusion
- Move useful bits from Package.Templates (for v8) into core package template (v9)
- Keep doing incremental updates to Our Umbraco
  - Better version discoverability for v9/NuGet packages
  - Display README from NuGet package
  - Show GitHub sponsorship/buy license button
  - Remove/clean up things (unlist old packages, v4/v6 version selection)
- Allow pushing new v9 versions using UmbPack
- Create documentation for package best practices (based on the [discussion](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Packages/discussions/132) Kevin started)

Long term goals:
- Move packages out of Our Umbraco (probably part of the Marketplace transition)
- Add Install on Umbraco Cloud button (similar to [Deploy to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/bs-cyrl-ba/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-azure-button))
  - Could power package backoffice install as well
  - Install package to existing Cloud project or new one (e.g. to quickly setup a package demo site)
- Package analytics/metrics
  - Lee Kelleher has already added telemetry to Contentment

## Any other business
Next meeting is on December 1st 2021.

## Tasks for next time
For next time we aim to have made progress on:

- Kevin
  - Create best practices documentation PR
- Ronald
  - Build/deploy pipeline for UI Examples
  - Have Zoom account upgraded to allow more than 40 minute meetings
