## Community Teams Visit

Discussed plan and logistics for the Teams visit on 21 & 22 September

Need to have a good plan in advance for how to spend the 2 days so we get the most from the event

People should book their own flights if not done already, hotels already booked by HQ


# New Marketplace and .com design

New umbraco.com site went live, as did new marketplace.umbraco.com


# Umbraco Lit Extension project by Dennis

Discussed this very useful 'bridging' approach that packages / implementors could start using now

Can see it already in practice on this particular branch of the URL Tracker:
https://github.com/Infocaster/UrlTracker/tree/v10/feature/redesign/src/UrlTracker.Backoffice.UI


# Team tasks and ideas

Reminder that there is the internal sheet for Teams tasks (pinned to Slack channel)


## Any other business

Next meeting is on 23/08/2023, but everyone should attend the Packages Question Time virtual meetup that is happening at the same time.
