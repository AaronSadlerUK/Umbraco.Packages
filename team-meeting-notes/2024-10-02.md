## Hacktoberfest
The wheels have started turning already with PRs on block preview packages (on Rick Butterfield's)
Virtual hackathon is Friday 11th / 12th (Candid Contrib)
Lots of packages now on the list to work through, Opinionated starter kit needs updating
Check PR checklist to merge in new packages
Discussed ways to promote Hacktoberfest more, link the packages repo to the Umbraco GitHub homepage?

## Migrated .com to Umbraco v13
Big shout out for the team on the migration, woo!!
If you find something, tell someone from Umbraco (MVP channel)

## Marketplace Hall Of Fame
The discussion was around how uMarketingSuite is handled now that it has been acquired by HQ.
The general feeling is that it should be removed in the hall of fame, but remain in historic awards (like Vendr).

## v15 RC
Out today and due for launch in November! Woop.
For packages, there is a prevelant update that allows for custom manifests.
