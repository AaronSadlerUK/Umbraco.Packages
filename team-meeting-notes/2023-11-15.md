Attendees: Dennis, Lotte, Mario, Richard, Ronald

Notetaker: Ronald

## Agenda
- Getting started with v14
- Any other business
- Tasks for next time

## Getting started with v14
The general feedback at this time is that a lot of users are struggling to get started with the new backoffice (Bellisima) in v14, specifically:
- How to setup your development environment
- Creating the entry point of a package or project specific extension (currently only umbraco-package.json files are dynamically picked up)
- Missing or changed paradigms, like prevalues (selectable values of a dropdown editor) and two-way binding/sharing state between components (e.g. dialogs with entity pickers)
- How to use the new Context APIs and create your own

Suggestions to improve both the teams and community knowledge were given:
- Invite Nathan Woulfe to give a demo/workshop on his progress with Workflow
- Contact package developers who have started with migrating to v14 (like Kevin Jump and Lee Kelleher)
- Setup a new Package Question Time

## Any other business
Next meeting is on [DATE].

## Tasks for next time
For next time we aim to have made progress on:

- Ronald: invite Nathan to give a demo/workshop
