## Status on Umbpack

No changes

## Status on Package Templates

We've merged in a [property editor](https://github.com/umbraco/Package.Templates/pull/26) itemtemplate and also a [custom tree](https://github.com/umbraco/Package.Templates/pull/34) example. There are a few further improvements we can add to the tree in the future.
With these 2 new item templates and the [Visual Studio template meta data improvements](https://github.com/umbraco/Package.Templates/pull/29) we are ready to create another release soon ðŸŽ‰

## Status on Umbraco.Packages issues

Merged a few smaller Our prs, we will have an upcoming problem when uSync hits 1 million downloads, some styling will need to be updated to accomodate such a massively successful package! 
A few hiccups still with the popularity score that needs further [review](https://github.com/umbraco/OurUmbraco/pull/620).

## Status on UI Examples

To be able to release this as a package we need a few things:

- Icons tab finalized
- Layout tab finalized
- Ensure same structure throughout, fx lang file areas need to be aligned
- Add lang file descriptions, etc where missing
- Reorgnize into new folder structure to follow all other item templates

If we need images we add an image folder in the contained folder and do a direct link from the html. 

Several other nice to have sections, but haven't been started on so will either have to be done by the time the above are, or make it into the next release ðŸ™‚

We have a specific build pipeline for an Umbraco zip package of this, can be invoked by pushing a `uiexamples/*` tag.

## Any other business

Next meeting is on January 7th.
