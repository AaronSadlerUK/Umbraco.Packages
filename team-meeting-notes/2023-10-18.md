## Hacktoberfest/Packtoberfest progress

https://umbra.co/packtoberfest - currently 13 packages and 3 projects listed on the Hacktoberfest package repo list to encourage community contributions

Had a very successful virtual hackathon on October 14th!

## dotnet new umbraco-package template for v14

Need to check on progress following the community teams visit

Perhaps time to make the RCL approach the default from v13 onwards

## Overview of top packages created during Community Teams Visit

List shared internally, idea is to keep an eye on how people are getting on and keep track, so we can reach out and help as and when! 

When package template is ready, and perhaps Niels Lyngs√∏'s talk is available online, might be idea to start contacting 'key' package developers to offer help and links etc

## UI Examples v14

To be discussed next time

## Upcoming Package Newsletter

Next packages newsletter coming out very soon, quick review of contents

## Any other business

Next meeting is on 1st Nov 2023.

## Tasks for next time

- Lotte: check in with Lee re the v14 template progress
- Ronald: release packages newsletter
