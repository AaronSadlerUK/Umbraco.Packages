## Lee Kelleher joining HQ
Award-winning package creator Lee Kelleher has joined HQ on a 6 month contract in the front-end team to help with v14 ðŸŽ‰

## Umbraco Community Day
Umbraco Community Day was on 13th Dec (why this meeting was delayed 1 week)
- All sessions are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwLOtzvx_o4&list=PLh_jm4oU4mFeffx43KAVbgpVwpmtXC13B), specifically of interest:

## Umbraco 13 LTS released
v13 (an LTS release) was released on 14th Dec. Now on v13.0.3. Adds webhooks, dynamic root and delivery API improvements amongst other things - [see HQ's blog post](https://umbraco.com/blog/umbraco-13-lts-release/)

## Umbraco v14 progress / support
Version 14.0.0-preview004 will be released soon(ish), focussing primarily around languages, templates, data types and publishing.

Starting in the new year, the package team should consolidate some 'getting started' information for package developers. This will need to be updated often as v14 gets closer and more resources are available (both from HQ and the community), so doing this as a blog post would be rather restrictive as to who can have ongoing edit rights. However if this was done in markdown files on the Package Team GitHub repo then the team and community members could raise PRs to add/edit the resources as and when required.

## Any other business
Next meeting is on 10th Jan 2024.

## Tasks for next time
Start the 'Getting started with v14' information
