## Status on Packages on v9

- HQ starting to move Forms and Deploy. Alpha at end of March should be worth package developers getting started with.
- How should package devs share information, ask questions? There is now a new 'v9' category on [Our Forum](https://our.umbraco.com/forum/umbraco-9/) which would be a good place to start.
- Kevin has been porting his ['fun stuff' repo](https://github.com/KevinJump/DoStuffWithUmbraco/tree/NetCore) to v9
- HQ have created a [new repository for V9 Docs](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbracoCmsDocs).
- Discussed adding ability to have version specific elements in package XML so a single package could support different v8 and v9 files. Must be done as non-breaking change. [Issue raised for further discussion](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/issues/10008).

## Status on Umbpack
