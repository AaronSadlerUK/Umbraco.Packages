## Status on Umbpack

v1.0.0 officially released during the Community Teams event last week ðŸŽ‰, then v1.0.1 soon after!

## Status on Package Templates

[PR 29](https://github.com/umbraco/Package.Templates/pull/29) (meta data changes which control how the dotnet new templates appear in VS) can be merged but agreed not worth a new release for that alone. Then needs issue raising that incorrect tags list showing in VS.

[PR 26](https://github.com/umbraco/Package.Templates/pull/26) (addition of property editor) 'samples' template needs removing from project template to be an item template only. Once this and perhaps contribution guidelines ([issue 28](https://github.com/umbraco/Package.Templates/issues/28)) updated then could be worth doing a release.

## Status on Umbraco.Packages issues

All package related issues have been moved over from Our so triage can begin.

## Status on UI Examples

First release to be done when enough content has been added, and reviewed for consistency and clarity. Will review at next meeting whether this looks likely before Christmas or, more realistically, early in the new year.

Progress being planned/tracked in [issue 33](https://github.com/umbraco/Package.Templates/issues/33).

## Any other business

Next meeting is on Thursday December 10th. The meeting after that however, December 24th, has been cancelled for obvious ðŸŽ… related reasons!
