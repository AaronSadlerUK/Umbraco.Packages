# Package team meeting January 26th, 2022
Attendees: Kevin, Lotte, Ronald

Notetaker: Ronald

## Agenda
- Best practices documentation PR
- Review package import feature for local Our.Umbraco install
- Any other business
- Tasks for next time

## Best practices documentation PR
Kevin showed his progress on the packages best practices documentation PR and was convinced to not trash it, but make a draft PR for it instead. Some topics might be too advanced for most package authors, so the aim of the draft PR is to rewrite it into something that can be read (and understood) by all Umbraco package creators.

## Review package import feature for local Our.Umbraco install
Lotte showed the dashboard for importing packages into a local Our.Umbraco install. It can fetch all packages from the our.umbraco.com XML feed, but doesn't yet persist it locally. The XML feed also doesn't contain all information, so this might require adding some dummy data. To get some help with this, the current code could be shared as a draft PR.

## Any other business
Next meeting is on February 9th, 2022.

## Tasks for next time
For next time we aim to have made progress on:

- Kevin
  - Create best practices documentation PR as draft
- Lotte
  - Create draft PR to get help in finishing the package import feature
