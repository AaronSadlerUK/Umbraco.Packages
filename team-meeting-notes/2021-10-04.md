## Status on Packages on v9
UI Examples needs released on v9. Check with Andy on how we would do this from HQ.
Need to move issues from the package templates to the UI Examples repo.


## Status on Umbpack
There's a few open issues on GitHub from people who are currently using the tool. Not much requirement for this going forward.


## Status on Package Templates

No issues


## Status on Umbraco.Packages issues

No issues


## Status on UI Examples

No issues


## Hacktoberfest

Umbra.co/packtoberfest has been updated to the latest version to include packages celebration, people have been contributing


## Any other business

The form that allows people to create packages on our could do with some love. Can we read nuget files and auto-populate the form?  
Editing the form is painful, feels like a wizard to create each time you want to make a small edit.  
Clear up discussions from the Package repo - https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Packages/discussions  
Do we need to communicate better with the core team in terms of updates that may be useful for package devs - example https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/pull/11216  
Is there scope for another workshop to go over a simple v9 package creation?  
  
Next meeting is on 18th October.

## Tasks for next time

For next time we aim to have made progress on:

Moving issues from the packages repo to the UI templates.
