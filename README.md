# Umbraco.Packages

Welcome to the GitHub home of the Umbraco Package team. If you want to read about the team's objectives and its current members, visit [the team page on the Our website](https://our.umbraco.com/get-involved/the-package-team/).

This issue tracker is used for tracking Package Team tasks, but is open for community involvement. It is also used for managing bugs and feature requests relating to the packages section of the [Our website](https://github.com/umbraco/OurUmbraco).

The Package Team also maintain:

- [UmbPack](https://github.com/umbraco/umbpack) - CLI tool to use in CI/CD to upload Umbraco .zip packages
- [Package Templates](https://github.com/umbraco/Package.templates) - a collection of templates for starting package development

## Issues

We have the following three issue types you can add to this tracker:

### Feature request

Use this issue type if you want to submit a feature request that has something to do with Umbraco CMS, Our functionality or package tooling, that you would like the Package Team members and contributors to discuss.

### Package idea

Use this issue type if you are looking for feedback on a package idea, or if you have an idea and are looking for help creating it.

### Request for collaborators

Use this issue type if you are looking for someone to help you maintain or update your package.

## Progress and roadmap

We will organize the issues into [projects](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Packages/projects) and work on one project at a time.

We also use this repository to track our progress and to display a [roadmap](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Packages/projects/3) for the Package team. The roadmap is found under the projects tab, and it will contain other projects in a Now - Next - Later structure.
