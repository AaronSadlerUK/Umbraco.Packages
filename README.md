# Umbraco.Packages

This is an issue tracker for the Umbraco Package team. We will organize the issues into [projects](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Packages/projects) and work on one project at a time.

## Issues

The issue tracker is used for tracking the Package Team tasks, but is also open for community involvement. We have the following three issue types you can add to this tracker:

### Feature request

Use this issue type if you want to submit a feature request that has something to do with Umbraco CMS, Our functionality or package tooling, that you would like the Package Team members and contributors to discuss.

### Package idea

Use this issue type if you are looking for feedback on a package idea, or if you have an idea and are looking for help creating it.

### Request for collaborators

Use this issue type if you are looking for someone to help you maintain or update your package.

## Progress and roadmap

We also use this repository to track our progress and to display a [roadmap](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Packages/projects/3) for the Package team. The roadmap is found under the projects tab, and it will contain other projects in a Now - Next - Later structure.

## Get in touch!

If you want to get in touch with the team about something not covered by our issues then feel free to reach out to any of us on Twitter, or write an email to packages@umbraco.com.
