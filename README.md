Welcome to the GitHub home of the Umbraco Package team. If you want to read about the team's objectives and its current members, visit [the team page on the community website](https://community.umbraco.com/learn-about-the-community/community-teams/the-package-team/).

This issue tracker is used for tracking Package Team tasks, but is open for community involvement.

The Package Team also maintain:

- [UI Examples](https://github.com/umbraco/ui-examples) - a package that adds a 'UI Examples' section to your Umbraco instance with working examples of how to customise the back-office

## Issues

We have the following three issue types you can add to this tracker:

### Feature request

Use this issue type if you want to submit a feature request that has something to do with Umbraco CMS, Marketplace functionality or package tooling, that you would like the Package Team members and contributors to discuss.

### Package idea

Use this issue type if you are looking for feedback on a package idea, or if you have an idea and are looking for help creating it.

### Request for collaborators

Use this issue type if you are looking for someone to help you maintain or update your package.

## Progress and roadmap

We will organize the issues into [projects](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Packages/projects) and work on one project at a time.

We also use this repository to track our progress and to display a [roadmap](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Packages/projects/3) for the Package team. The roadmap is found under the projects tab, and it will contain other projects in a Now - Next - Later structure.
